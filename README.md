Disease Identification
=====================
Background: Current clinicians work on taking symptoms as the ground for prediction of diseases. Many technologies and 
biomedical devices are used to for diagnosis and prediction purposes. It is a challenging method to base the diagnosis on 
symptoms for we have no measure on the exact quantity, quality and extremeness. This can also lead to fatal results in case 
of diseases like cancer, where the progressing of our current system, i.e., based on symptoms and if no improvements then 
going for other tests provide the disease enough time to progress. Also as the typical symptoms of the disease are shown 
at a later stage, we have a high mortality rate associated with some of the very common diseases. A solution to this 
would be to have a system that easily identifies a change in the condition of the patient and is able to predict the 
condition. This system should provide the optimal solution between accuracy and the cost of detection.
