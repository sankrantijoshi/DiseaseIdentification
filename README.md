DiseaseIdentification
=====================
Background: Current clinicians work on taking symptoms as the ground for prediction of diseases. Many technologies and 
biomedical devices are used to for diagnosis and prediction purposes. It is a challenging method to base the diagnosis on 
symptoms for we have no measure on the exact quantity, quality and extremeness. This can also lead to fatal results in case 
of diseases like cancer, where the progressing of our current system, i.e., based on symptoms and if no improvements then 
going for other tests provide the disease enough time to progress. Also as the typical symptoms of the disease are shown 
at a later stage, we have a high mortality rate associated with some of the very common diseases. A solution to this 
would be to have a system that easily identifies a change in the condition of the patient and is able to predict the 
condition. This system should provide the optimal solution between accuracy and the cost of detection.

Results: In this paper, we try to present a novel system that works on protein data and DNA data and data types. It is 
based on the fact that the presence of a disease must alter the protein expression of the body and should alter the DNA 
and protein sequence obtained from the body. We take in the sequence data of the patient and along with the symptom data 
try to provide the most accurate result of the present diseases. 
The system has been used to test the data available for pancreatitis and breast cancer to demonstrate the results. 
The knowledge base is maintained for the mutation data and disease symptom data. The data taken in is of Fasta format and 
is maintained in the same format in the database available.

Conclusions: The system integrates various mutations found in the onset of breast cancer and pancreatitis. Some other 
mutations are added based on their presence found in the patients of these diseases based of some previous works done. 
Other general mutations found in almost all kinds of cancers are also added. The system is currently being expanded to add 
additional data for various other diseases such as lung cancer and alzheimerâ€™s.
